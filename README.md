# hello-world
Ideas, collaboration, etc.

Hello everyone! My name is Kenneth C. Albright, but I go by my initials: K.C., so that's what you guys can call me! If you'd like. 
Anyway, welcome to my Github, and specifically, my READ ME file in my new hello-world repository. I haven't quite decided what I want to utilize this repository for yet, but I am sure it will come to me in time. The longer I am coding, the more projects will come my way, so I am sure my Github will be populated soon enough!

I am an Apprentice Web Developer working for Evolving Software, a Software Company looking to change how business in our sector is done! We wish to make coding a viable career opportunity for ANYONE, regardless of a college degree or prior knowledge!
